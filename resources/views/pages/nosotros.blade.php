          That sounds fun! If you like adventure, there are many ways to incorporate it into your travels. Some ideas

          Climb mountains or go hiking in destinations with impressive landscapes, such as Patagonia, the Alps or the
          Himalayas.
          Go rafting or kayaking in exciting rivers, such as the Rio Grande in the United States or the Futaleuf√∫ River
